# TAASCOR Attendance Monitoring System
**Company**: TAASCOR Management & General Services Corp.

A full-stack, enterprise attendance and workforce management web application built for TAASCOR operations across assigned warehouses and areas.

---

## Key Features

- **Strict Three-Role Architecture**: `ADMIN`, `HR`, and `COORDINATOR`. Employees are managed records without login accounts.
- **Company Email Authentication**: Coordinator registration strictly restricted to verified `@taascor.com` email addresses, requiring HR approval and warehouse assignment before access is granted.
- **Warehouse-Level Data Isolation**: Coordinators are strictly restricted to their assigned area. Cross-area access is blocked at the database and middleware layers.
- **Employee Masterfile**: Active and Inactive views. Inactivation permanently preserves all historical attendance, schedules, and clearance cases.
- **Dynamic Scheduling**: Individual and group scheduling, overnight shifts crossing midnight, conflict detection, and weekly matrix view.
- **Daily Attendance Marking**: Bulk table marking with status differentiation (Present, Late, Absent, On Leave, Rest Day). Confirmed absences automatically trigger or link Back-to-Work cases.
- **Coordinator Self-Attendance**: Server-timestamped Time-In and Time-Out with HR correction request workflow.
- **Forum-Style Requests & Concerns Hub**:
  - **Back-to-Work Clearance**: Absence linking, thread updates, authorized return date, and HR decision highlights.
  - **Employee Concerns**: Categories, HR directives, and resolution tracking.
  - **Manpower Requests**: Position breakdown, HR worker allocation (external or transfer), coordinator arrival confirmation, and automatic masterfile registration.
- **Excel (.xlsx) & CSV Export**: Streamed report generation with area-level permissions enforced.
- **Real-Time Notification Polling**: Unread badges and direct link navigation.
- **Full Audit Trail**: Immutable logging of system actions with IP tracking.
